Hi,

The following projects (each file is a seprate project) automate weekly analytics reporting kepping in mind where files need to be saved and what naming conventions need to be used.

The following three modules are used extensively

- Xlwings
- OS
- Docx

While the code cannot be reused because it custom for the project, it does show how I approach programming, and use it to solve problems.

Also please note, the code on the repository are excerpts from projects to ensure no company specific data or proprietary product is revealed in any way.
