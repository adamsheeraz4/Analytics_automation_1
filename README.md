Hi,

The following projects automate weekly analytics reporting kepping in mind where files need to be saved and what naming conventions need to be used.

The following three modules are used extensively

- Xlwings
- OS
- Docx

While the code cannot be reused because it custom for the project, it does show how I approach programming, and use it to solve problems.
